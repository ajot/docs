## Preface

I’ve spent several years playing around with these APIs and building hacks all over. This is a Python guide that includes things I have used over and over several times. It is not a comprehensive guide. It is not a reference guide that includes everything about the API. But it promises one thing—you will get started and make that "Hello World" quickly. The goal is to reduce your time to "Hello World" drastically. This is how I think all "Hello World" guides should be designed. If I could, I would go add a page that says "Hello World" to each of these APIs and include these guides in there.

## Audience

This field guide is designed for:
- **Freelance Developers**: Independent contractors who need to quickly integrate APIs into their projects.
- **Tech-Savvy Entrepreneurs**: Small business owners who handle various technical tasks and want to streamline operations.
- **Junior Developers and Interns**: Aspiring professionals looking to gain practical experience with API integrations.
- **Tinkerers and Hobbyists**: Individuals who enjoy experimenting with automation and coding projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the guides, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **API Keys**: You should have API keys for the APIs you intend to use. Each guide will assume you have already obtained these keys and stored them in a `.env` file.
2. **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. These examples are written in Python and require Python 3.6 or higher.
3. **Packages**: You will need to install some Python packages. Each guide will specify the required packages and how to install them.

### Setting Up Your Environment

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/api-hello-world-examples.git
cd api-hello-world-examples
```

#### Step 2: Install Required Packages

Each guide will list the packages you need to install. Generally, you can use pip to install these packages. For example:

```sh
pip install python-dotenv openai resend twilio assemblyai
```

#### Step 3: Create a .env File

Create a `.env` file in the project root to store your API keys and other environment variables. Here is an example of what your `.env` file might look like:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
RESEND_EMAIL_FROM=your_email_from_address
RESEND_EMAIL_TO=recipient_email_address
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_FROM=your_twilio_phone_number
TWILIO_PHONE_TO=recipient_phone_number
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_assemblyai_api_key
```

### Running the Examples

   - [Read the guide](./assemblyai-lemur-example)

#### Running a Script

To run any of the provided scripts, ensure your `.env` file is in the same directory as the script, and then execute the script using Python. For example:

```sh
python resend-email-example.py
```

## Conclusion

These guides are designed to help you quickly get started with various APIs. By following the instructions and examples, you will gain a solid understanding of how to integrate and use these APIs in your own projects. Happy coding!
